> I'm a part of the [Language & Technology Research Group](https://sites.google.com/tc.columbia.edu/al-tesol-language-technology/home) at Teachers College (TC), Columbia University, a growing group of curious people researching the impact of emerging technology, especially natural language tech, on education. You can also see the trainings and workshops I developed for the group [here](../../tags/language-technology).

## Context 

Each year, the [Community Language Program (CLP)](https://www.tc.columbia.edu/communitylanguage/) at TC serves hundreds of adult English learners in NYC and visiting scholars & professionals from all over the world. It is also a "language lab" for TC's professors & graduate students in linguistics and pedagogy research. Researchers and instructors need a [tailored, accessible, and efficient system for longitudinal analysis](https://sites.google.com/tc.columbia.edu/al-tesol-language-technology/projects/altec-learner-corpus?authuser=0) of the massive language output and learner-instructor interactions in CLP.

## Design highlights

- A web application with an intuitive interface and _zero demand for users to write code_. 
- Streamlines with CLP transcription data generated by human and AI annotators. 
- Built-in database supports unlimited uploading, parsing, storing, and deleting of transcriptions. 
- Core features include word queries, visual airtime breakdown (per class and overall), and speaker filtering. 
- Modular design allows for easy integration of additional features.

## Tools

`Python`, `Flask`, `HTML/CSS`, `SQL`, `Regex`, `Visual Studio Code`, `Git`, `ChatGPT` as pair programmer.

## Role

I developed the project independently, while continuously integrating feedback from research group members to ensure the project met collective goals. I was responsible for the conceptualization, architecture, database schema, user interface & experience design, development, testing, and documentation of the project.
