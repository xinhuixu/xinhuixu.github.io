# Intro 
On November 23, 2023, PewDiePie, a popular YouTube content creator who once held the record of having the most subscribers on the platform, published a video titled ‚Äú[Teaching myself to draw for no reason.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMLEudGbxQk)‚Äù, where he flips through his sketchbook and comments on what he drew and learned as a total beginner for the past 30 days.

PewDiePie subsequently published [‚ÄúI Drew Every Day for 100 DAYS!‚Äù](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJDtQTTAogk&t=201s) and ["I Drew Every Day for 365 Days‚Ä¶.. *it was painful"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPLImB-I71w) in a similar format. As of November 2024, the three videos grossed over 14 million views.

This type of videos, where an individual tries to take on a new skill and document every step of their journey, have become an entire genre on YouTube in recent years. Titles like ‚Äú1 Year of Learning Web Development (Self Taught)‚Äù or ‚ÄúMy One-Year Guitar Progress‚Äù are just a few examples that attract millions of views.

Clearly, this genre of videos is resonating with people. **Now, the question is: is it an effective way to learn? ¬†What can learning designers, researchers, and learners learn from these videos?**
