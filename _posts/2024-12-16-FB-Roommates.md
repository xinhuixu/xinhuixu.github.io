> Team project for UX Design, Fall 2024, taught by the wonderful [Abby Adams](https://www.linkedin.com/in/adamsabigail/). 
{: .prompt-info }

From Sep-Oct 2024, our team of 4 UX design newbies set out to do user research on our randomly assigned group, **people with roommates**. Armed with insights from our affinity maps, personas, and user need statements, we carried on to the design and prototyping phase from Nov-Dec 2024.

## Product description

**Facebook Roommates** is a platform designed to help people find compatible roommates within their local community or desired area. Users can easily create roommate profiles with a template that showcases their lifestyle preferences, interests, and housing needs. 

The platform features an interface, similar to the widely popular Facebook Marketplace, for browsing profiles and messaging potential roommate matches securely within Facebook and Messenger. Users can also share their profile to Facebook Groups or link it in external sites.

Integrated with Facebook, it fosters trust and transparency while simplifying the roommate search process. Whether you’re moving to a new city or looking to fill an empty room, Facebook Roommates makes finding the perfect match seamless and stress-free.

## My role
I collaborated with my teammates for the user research and all design iterations. I was also the project manager for both phases, coordinating the team meetings, weekly milestones, task distribution, external comms (with research participants and instructor), file management, and presentation logistics.
