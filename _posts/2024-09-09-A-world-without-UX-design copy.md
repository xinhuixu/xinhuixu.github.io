To make people realize how important something is, we must rob it from them.

In this spirit, my teammate [Chenyu](https://www.linkedin.com/in/chenyu-ye-3660bb263/) and I have built this spot-the-UX-fails activity for a class of 19 grad students brand-new to the world of UX.  

[**Here's the mock webpage ("The Form.html")....**](https://xinhuixu.github.io/unsuspicious-form/)

[**And here's the final list of all UX fails we built.**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pQRbtq2g8a3RzCzHxtoP5sMm3Up1aH8HVGRvHwvgFBQ/edit?usp=sharing)

# Learning objectives

- **Describe the value of good user experience**
- **Recognize and apply the Fundamental Principles of Interaction in the form of a design critique**

> **Context:** Every week, a different pair of UX Design students become the Topic Leaders (TL) and co-lead an original short activity for the class. We led the first TL week — an intro to UX— and our readings included classics such as Chapter One of *The Design of Everyday Things* by Don Norman, several of Don’s videos on the Nielson Norman Group channel, and chapters about the product team from *Inspired* by Marty Cagan.

**Some activity design highlights:**
- Custom built webpage with UX fails aligned to our reading
- The activity is grounded in a (somewhat plausibly) authentic backstory for immersion for a class of beginner UX learners
- The “deliverable” of the activity, as a Slack message, is authentic. Based on what we read about roles in a product team, UX designers constantly need to collaborate with other functions and/or justify the value of UX

# Roles
Chenyu and I ideated the bad UX designs; Chenyu prototyped them and I built it using HTML/CSS/JS.
