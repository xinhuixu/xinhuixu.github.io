## Design highlights

- **Cross-device compatibility:** Fully responsive with smartphones, tablets, and desktops.
- **Interactive floor guide:** Helps guests quickly locate facilities and amenities.
- **Housekeeping rules:** Visually explains guidelines to ensure a safe, enjoyable stay and preserve the traditional Japanese-style building.
