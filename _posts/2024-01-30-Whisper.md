> I'm a part of the [Language & Technology Research Group](https://sites.google.com/tc.columbia.edu/al-tesol-language-technology/home) at Teachers College (TC), Columbia University, a growing group of curious people researching the impact of emerging technology, especially natural language tech, on education. This is one of the trainings and workshops I developed for both internal audience and the greater TC community. I've also developed a web application, which you can see [here](../../posts/Corpus).
