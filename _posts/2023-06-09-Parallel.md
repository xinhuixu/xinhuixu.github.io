> Since 2022, I've worked for [Principia Tutors & Consultants](https://www.principiatutors.com/){:target="_blank"}, a dedicated group of educators serving K-12 learners in the Greater Washington, D.C. metro area. All of material I developed for Principia are for internal use, except for this video for our YouTube channel. Feel free to contact me if you're interested in seeing more work.
