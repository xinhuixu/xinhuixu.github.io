> Hi! Thanks for stopping by.
{: .prompt-tip }

I'm Xinhui, and I use this site as a digital portfolio for selected personal and professional projects I've done.

My main arena is [**instructional design**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instructional_design){:target="_blank"}, which means I build content and/or interactive experiences that help people learn effectively. 

## Pages

On smaller screens,  tap the menu on the top left to unhide/hide the side bar for navigation.

My projects are listed chronologically the [**Home**](../..) page.

A short bio is on the [**About**](../../about/) page.

You can also check out my projects by [**Categories**](../../categories/), filter by [**Tags**](../../tags/) of interest, or see them on a timeline on [**Archives**](../../archives).

On the bottom of the side bar, you can switch the site between **dark/light theme**.
