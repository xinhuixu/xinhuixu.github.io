> This is a part of the instructional material I created during my time as an [AmeriCorps](https://americorps.gov/){:target="_blank"} mathematics tutor at Match High School at the heart of Boston, MA. This was an incredibly rewarding one-year experience, and I recommend it to any rising grad interested in education. [Feel free to connect](mailto:xinhuixu02@gmail.com) if you are interested in being an AmeriCorps tutor; I'd love to share my experiences.
