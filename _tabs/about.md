> Hi! Thanks for stopping by.
{: .prompt-tip }

I'm Xinhui, and I use this site as a digital portfolio for selected personal and professional projects I've done.

My main arena is [**instructional design**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instructional_design), which means I build content and/or interactive experiences that help people learn effectively. 

- My first name is pronounced like `shin-way`. 
    - It means "new wisdom" in Mandarin Chinese.
    - My last name is pronounced like `shoo`.

- I'm based in NYC, where I grew up. I've also lived, studied, and worked in Massachussets, Virginia, Japan, and Malaysia, where I'm lucky to have met many incredible educator-mentors whose teaching continue to shape the way I create.

- I received my B.A. from Wellesley College in 2021.

- In my free time, I enjoy museums, parks, movies, libraries, cooking and baking, boardgames, and making art, which includes super-amateur photography. This is a mutable list...
